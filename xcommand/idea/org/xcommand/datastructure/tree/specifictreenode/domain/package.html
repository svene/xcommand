<p>
	This package contains TreeNodes which in addition to the tree specific
	functionality contains application specific functionality. This means
	that the <em>separation of concerns</em> principle is violated.
</p>

<p>
	To be able to adhere to the <em>separation of concerns</em> principle class
	<code>TreeNode</code> contains a property <code>DomainObject</code> which
	provides a means to connect a Domain Object to a TreeNode. This is the preferred
	way to work with tree structures.
